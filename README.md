IMDB WebApp for Data Analysis 

In this project I have successfully made an end to end system which allows us to browse relevant data for movies and tv
shows provided in the IMDB dataset. I have utilized MySQL, php, bootstrap, HTML and CSS to implement this web based system. 
The system has the following features - 
  1. Ability to search for browse biographies of people in the database to find their birth year, primary professions and the    
     movies that they are best known for working in. 
  2. Ability to search for movies using parameters like genre, rating and release year. The movie details are then shown. 
  3. The ability to search for a TV show by name and explore the details of each of itâ€™s seasons. 
  4. Ability to search for movie by name to view its release year and genre and explore it in greater detail. 
  5. The ability browse movies and the cast and crew associated with it to allow the user to discover new movies. 

The entire project was executed by completing the following steps:
  1) Creating an E-R diagram.
  2) Create a Relationship Schema.
  3) Data Cleaning: Since the dataset that is provided is raw, it contains null value and redundant values which had to be removed.
  4) Loading to SQL database: After cleaning the dataset had to be loaded in the SQL database.
  5) Designing queries to implement functionality.
  6) Designing framework: To plan the front-end and back-end structure.
  7) Development and testing.
